//
// <br>: line break html element
//
// The HTML <br> element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is
// useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/br
// The <br> element has a single, well-defined purpose â€” to create a line break
// in a block of text. As such, it has no dimensions or visual output of its own,
// and there is very little you can do to style it.
